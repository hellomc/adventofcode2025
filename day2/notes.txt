Day 2

Input
- Given as text in single line
- Ranges in start-end values
- comma separated ranges

Part 1

Objective: Identify invalid IDs and sum up all invalid IDs

What is an invalid ID?
- some subsequence of digits of various length that repeats twice
example
- 11-22: 11 and 22 are invalid, 1 and 2 repeats 2x
- 6464: 64 repeats 2x
- 123123: 123 repeats 2x

Thoughts
- invalid id has to be some even length (check end value for length)
- do i need to generate every single number in the range?
