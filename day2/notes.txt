Day 2

Input
- Given as text in single line
- Ranges in start-end values
- comma separated ranges

Part 1

Objective: Identify invalid IDs and sum up all invalid IDs

What is an invalid ID?
- some subsequence of digits of various length that repeats twice
example
- 11-22: 11 and 22 are invalid, 1 and 2 repeats 2x
- 6464: 64 repeats 2x
- 123123: 123 repeats 2x

Thoughts
- invalid id has to be some even length (check end value for length)
- do i need to generate every single number in the range?

Pseudocode

Get ranges from file
Comma-separated values
Then separate by dash start-end
Output list of tuple ranges [(start, end),..(startN, endN)]

evaluate start-end ranges
for id in range(start, end + 1):
    if len(str(num)) % 2 == 0: looking for even length
        evaluate for invalid number
            check if there is subsequence of numbers and it repeats 2x
        if invalid add to list of invalid numbers

calculate sum of valid numbers

part 2

sequence repeats at least twice
check all possible lengths of sequences in string
